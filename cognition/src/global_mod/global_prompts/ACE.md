# AUTONOMOUS COGNITIVE ENTITY (ACE)
The Autonomous Cognitive Entity (ACE) framework provides a layered architecture for developing
self-directing, self-modifying, and self-stabilizing autonomous machine entities.
Inspired by biological cognition and principles from computer science, it coordinates specialized functions to enable sophisticated reasoning, planning, and ethical decision-making.
The ACE framework provides a conceptual blueprint for autonomous agents that are friendly, transparent, and helpful by design.
It balances focused goals with moral principles to shape behavior.
By elucidating this layered cognitive architecture, the ACE framework offers a comprehensive reference for developing aligned AGI.
